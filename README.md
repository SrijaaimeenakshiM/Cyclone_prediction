# Cyclone Prediction - Time Series Forecasting 🌪️

Welcome to the **Cyclone Prediction Project**, which focuses on predicting cyclones in the Indian Ocean region using time series analysis and machine learning techniques.

This project aims to forecast cyclone formation, intensity, and potential landfall based on historical cyclone datasets.

## 📄 Project Overview
The **Cyclone Prediction Project** provides:
- Cyclone formation and intensity prediction.
- Time series analysis using cyclone datasets.
- Visualizations of cyclone patterns and predictions.
- An educational approach to sequence modeling and forecasting.

## 💪 Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (if deep learning is used)

## 🚀 Features
- Time series forecasting of cyclone events.
- Cyclone classification by intensity (Strong, Moderate, Weak).
- Predict cyclone formation and potential landfall.
- Visual data exploration and plotting.

## ⚙️ Requirements
You need the following Python packages:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` (if used)

Install them using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## 🚀 How to Run

### 📥 Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SrijaaimeenakshiM/Cyclone_prediction.git
```

### 🔢 Navigate to the Project Folder
```bash
cd Cyclone_prediction
```

### 📦 Install the Required Packages
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```

### 💻 Open the Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook cyclone_prediction.ipynb
```

Run the cells step by step to process the dataset, build the prediction model, and visualize the cyclone forecasts.

## 📊 Dataset
The project uses cyclone datasets from the North and South Indian Ocean regions, including features like cyclone position, wind speed, pressure, and formation details.

You can further customize the dataset with real-time cyclone tracking data.
